==========

# Syllabus
## Pre-workshop exercise: Try-R

## Workshop
### Programming = Magic
Live demo: Create files (create_data function) and visualizations (plot_data) in real time
By the end of the workshop you will build similar functions

What are we going to do in this workshop?
- Describe data analysis workflow: One workshop for each stage
- Use a toy example to describe how we can implement and streamline this workflow with R
- Along the way we will review some of R core concepts and building blocks. 

### Intro to Rstudio & Package
R = language
Rstudio = Interface
Package = App on your phone

### Read files in Read
- concept of working directory
- Read 1 file
- List files
- Read multiple files

End with Rstudio projects + directory organization 

### Explore data
- Summary
- Table
- Analyse missing data (keep only matching records)

### The power of looping
We want to know about missing data for each file / state
- How to identify missing rows
- Concept of a function
- Concept of looping

### Cleaning data
data cleaning (sub-setting), reshape / dplyr / plyr
- keep matching rows
- from wide to long
